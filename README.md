External Links
==============

This is a TYPO3 CMS extension to handle external links within the new
LinkHandler popup, introduced in the version 8 of TYPO3 CMS. The extension
provides a basic table to store the external links. The extension displays the
basic functionalities to create / read / update / delete the external links.

Link Validator
--------------

The extension integrates itself with the LinkValidator extension. There is
nothing special to do. A new LinkType will be declared when installing the
extension and will display a new entry in the LinkValidator BE module.
